Ubuntu Live Remote Support via TeamViewer
  
### Description
Installation script for Ubuntu Live  
  
The Ubuntu Live version lacks of applications to remote help Lusers (Lack of technical experience users). Installing all libraries for remote applications in the live ecosystem is a pain in the ass.  
So when your friend has crashed the veracrypt bootloader, pull this script and let them `sudo bash install.sh` it. TeamViewer gets autodeployed.
